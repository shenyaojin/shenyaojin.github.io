# Shenyao's GitHub Page

This is the source code for my personal site, built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) theme by [Poole](https://github.com/poole).

## 📖 Overview

- **Theme:** Lanyon (a minimal Jekyll theme)
- **Content:** Personal blog, research notes, and pages
- **License:** GNU General Public License v2.0

## 🚀 Development

To build and serve the site locally:

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Then visit `http://localhost:4000` in your browser. For the second time you can just press `cmd` + `shift` + `B` to start the server.

### Requirements

- Ruby 3.x (recommended via Homebrew or rbenv)
- Bundler (`gem install bundler`)
- Jekyll (installed via the `github-pages` gem)
