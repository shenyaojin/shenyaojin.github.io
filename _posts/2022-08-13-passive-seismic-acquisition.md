# DAS based microseismic monitoring

It could only detect the strain rate. We could detect the distance from the profile but we would get a circle for we don't know the direction. Thus we need vertical and horizontal fiber, then we could get the accurate location of the microseismic event. If we have **more fibers**, that would be better. So as the **borehole** measurement.  

# Dark fiber

They have a very, very large range and density under the city or under the ocean. 

# Case Study

## Aftershock monitoring
Collect the DAS data using the dark fiber.

## Surface wave: Rayleigh & Love Waves
I'm familiar with this.

## Interferometric analysis
By stacking the cross-correlation data between one station to another station, we could obtain the seismic wave generated by the virtual source.
