# Laser

- Type
  - Broad spectrum laser
  - Narrow spectrum or single frequency
  - Tunable laser

> temperature will shift the frequency of laser.

# EDFA

It is a kind of optical amplifiers. Amplify the signal **before it is injected into the fiber**.****

Like the amplifier in geophones, it will increase the noise level but won't change SNR. Enable the signal to compete with other noise.

# Optical Couplers
Split the signal into two signals in a pre-defined ratio. Could be reversed.

# Optical circulator

There will be 3 ports in optical circulator. And: 

Port 1 --> Port 2

Port 2 --> Port 3

Port 3 --> Port 1

# Fiber Bragg Gratings(FBG)
I have touched it while learning physics.

Note that it could measure variation of temperature and strain.

# Switch
Can connect one instrument with multiple fibers. This part is common in distributed systems.

# Fiber Splice and Connecter
Must note to connect the right type or you'll damage it.

# Example
