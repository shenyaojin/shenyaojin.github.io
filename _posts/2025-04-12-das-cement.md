Here is the pdf file of my 2025 IMAGE conference paper. It once violates ExxonMobil's confidentiality policy, lol.

Anyway, in this conference paper we proposed a new workflow to estimate the cement bond quality using the LFDAS method. We will 
soon publish the full paper in SPE journal.

This paper is selected to be presented at the IMAGE'25 conference in Houston, Texas, USA, August 26th, 2025.
