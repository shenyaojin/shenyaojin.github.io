# Two types of DAS system

- Intensity-based system
  - first gen
  - not quantitive
  - cheaper & robustness
  - Amplitude of Rayleigh backscattered energy

- Phase-based system
  - second gen
  - quantitative
  - expansive

# Intensity based system
## Principle of intensity-based system

The perturbed fiber will have a different intensity image:

## Experiments on intensity-based system

2-m fiber -> non-linear and random. Not easy to use.

# Phase based system
Complicated, but could provide quantitative result. 

## Principle
![](/images/blog/DAS/12.png)
The first pulse: 
$$
\delta\phi_1(z,t_1)=\phi(z+\delta z, t_1)-\phi(z,t_1)=2k\Delta z+c_0
$$
The second pluse: because of the strain in fiber, there will be a distortion $$\delta z$$.

$$
\delta\phi_2(z,t_1)=\phi(z+\delta z, t_2)-\phi(z,t_2)=2k\Delta z+2k\delta z+c_0
$$

The differential phase: 
$$
d\phi(z, t_1) = \delta \phi_2-\delta \phi_1=2k\delta z
$$

Note that $$\delta z$$ is much smaller than $$\Delta z$$. Change in length will change in refractive index(assume it's linear).

Then, 
$$
\delta \phi = \frac{4\pi nL_G}{\lambda}[\frac{\Delta x}{x}+\frac{\Delta n
}{n}]
$$

--> 
$$
\delta \varepsilon_{xx}(t, x_j)\approx 1.16\times 10^{-10}\delta \Phi(rad)
$$

Note that this is happened in **one** time and **one** channel.
