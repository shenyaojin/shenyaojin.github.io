The rule is simple. Don't update the system if you don't have the need.



Before I updated my linux, it works well while running seismic unix. But after I update it to the latest version, it couldn't work and while I tried to reinstall it, it calls back:

```makefile
r - elco_scalar.o
rm -f elco_scalar.o
gcc -c -I/home/shenyao-jin/geophysics-software/su/include -O  -std=c99 -Wall -pedantic -Wno-long-long  -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -D_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE -DCWP_LITTLE_ENDIAN -DSUXDR  -D_DEFAULT_SOURCE -D_POSIX_SOURCE fgettr.c

```

I know there lacks a lib, but I couldn't do anything -- I'm not a expert to deal with it. So I searched for Internet, and surpring to find that no ubuntu user has this problem ... there is a Fedora user faced the same problem like me, but it doesn't work while I tried the same method. I felt sad and if I have a chance, I will find a member of CWP and ask him to give me the executable file. I don't want to compile the troublesome code any more...
