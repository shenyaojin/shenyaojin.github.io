# Summer Plan in 2022

## Summer Research in CSM

I should do some DAS-related research, and I need to do some work on seismic wave imaging. I have continueously learnt math, physics and programming in the last three years but had no chance to do some real work in geophysics, I really feel eager to process some data to enhance my understanding in handling in seismic data.

## Complete the project from Prof. Xia

Xia is a very pretigious scientist in surface wave analysis. I'm interested in his research for a long time but I was allowed to do some work with him is not long ago, after I finish the project in NCC.

## Finish my TOEFL test

Because of COVID-19, TOEFL test is canceled in many times from Feb to June. So I have no choice but come to US to finish it. I believe here I will have more communication with natives and improve my speaking, which is really poor.

## Complete my first article on NCC

I have finished part of the code work of data analysis of **N**orth **C**hina **C**raton. And I believe it's time to post the result of my work. So I decide to finish the paper in summer vacation. It's really hard-working.
