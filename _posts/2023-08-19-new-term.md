After I end my BA life in Zhejiang University, I became a Ph.D student of RCP in geophysics, CO School of Mines. I have more time to bury into learning those various things and able to record them in my blog. Hence, there are less Chinese guy around me, so maybe it's time for me to start to record my diary on my blog... It would be a much more private thing ever, but I don't want to turn this github repo to a private one :).
