The wave propagation likes seismic wave, here's the energy: 

$$
E_p(z) = E_p(0)exp\int_0^z-\alpha(u)du
$$

Backscattered energy: 
$$
dE_{BS}(z, z+dz) = (E_p(0)exp\int_0^z-\alpha(u)du)\cdot\alpha_R(z)B(z)exp\int_0^z-\alpha(u)du
$$

$\alpha_R(z)$ is Rayleigh Scatter Coefficient. That represents the energy that transferred to Rayleigh wave. 

B(z) is the energy that the receiver will receive. Not all the energy will reflect in OTDR.
