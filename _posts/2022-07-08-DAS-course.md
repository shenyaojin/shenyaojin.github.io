# DFOS Applications introduction

DFOS (Distributed Fiber Optic Sensing) could take vibration, temperature and strain measurement on a  fibre that is ten's kilometers long.

## Principle

Interrogator & fiber.

A laser pulse -> reflection(including Rayleigh, Raman and Brillouin )

- Reman: sensitive to temperature. (DTS, distributed temperature sensing)
- Brillouin: sensitive to strain and temperature. (DSS, distributed strain sensing)
- Rayleigh: sensitive to strain and temperature. (DAS, distributed acoustic sensing)

## Benefit
- small size(as hair)
- endurance to harsh environments(made of glass)
- no electronic(no interference )
- high resolution(?)
- cheap
- continuous measurement

## Example

- 4D VSP: *4D DAS VSP as a tool for frequent seismic monitoring in deep water*
- DTS monitoring cement curing: *A review of rheological modeling of cement slurry in oil well applications*
- DTS pipeline leak detection
- DSS on pipeline and landslide monitoring: *A decade of pipeline geotechnical monitoring using distributed fiber optic monitoring technology*
