# Four key criteria
- Measurement resolution
- Spatial resolution
- Measurement range
- Measurement time(AKA temporal resolution)

> They have *close* relationship. 

# Measurement Resolution

It means how small the physical quantity changes that the sensor can measure.

resolution $$\approx$$ sensitivity $$\ne$$ accuracy

# Measurement Range
It is usually determined by the length of fiber.

# Spatial resolution

spatial resolution is $$\delta z$$ in this figure.

- Solid line is actual measurement 
- Broken line is detected by the sensor.

# Measurement time
