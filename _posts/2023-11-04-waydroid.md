# Introduction to Waydroid

Waydroid is a container-based approach to boot a full Android system on a regular GNU/Linux system. Waydroid uses Linux namespaces (user, pid, uts, net, mount, ipc) to run a full Android system in a container and provide Android applications on any GNU/Linux-based platform (arm, arm64, x86, x86_64). The Android system inside the container has direct access to needed hardware through LXC and the binder interface.

# Preparation

1. Wayland compositor
2. Intel/AMD GPU
3. (Optional) Arch/Manjaro Distribution

# Installation

1. Install the software in [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/waydroid), using yay (arch) or pamac(manjaro).

2. Command to install Google frame: 

   ```shell
   sudo waydroid init -s GAPPS -f
   ```

3. Start Waydroid service: 

   ```shell
   sudo systemctl start waydroid-container
   ```

4. Show UI:

   ```shell
   waydroid show-full-ui
   ```

5. Install lzip(package) and [Waydroid script](https://github.com/casualsnek/waydroid_script.git):

   1.  in this script, please install gapps(for Google frame), libndk(translator from x86 frame to ARM frame on **AMD** GPU) or libhoudini(translator from x86 frame to ARM frame on **Intel** GPU), magisk.
   2. Get Google Device ID to Get Certified, follow the instruction.

6. tweak for touch screen:

   ```shell
   waydroid prop set persist.waydroid.fake_touch "*"
   ```

   Then we can play Fate/GO on this subsystem lol.
