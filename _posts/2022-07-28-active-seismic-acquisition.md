# Seismic Survey
Surface seismic and vertical seismic profiling.

- Surface Seismic
  - Low cost
  - Better 3D **coverage**
  - Rarely used for DAS (Receiver sensitivity, for it's only sensitive along the fiber. )

- VSP
  - One-way attenuation
  - Less depth/time **uncertainty**
  - Better coverage around the well

# Helical cable for vertical sensitivity
- Not 3 component receiver
- Increase sensitivity to high angle wave. 

# Advantages for DAS in VSP

It has much higher accuracy and a higher range for it has a much higher density than geophone. 

# Different types of VSP

Includes zero offset, offset. walk-away, cross-well, reverse and deviated borehole. 

# 4D DAS VSP
 It enables us to monitor the structure. The source and receiver should be the same or very similar, and the fiber could be installed in the place permanently.  

## Case: Offshore
DAS is much more cheaper than 4D OBN, and it has a similar result compared with 4D OBN.

## Case: Unconventional hydraulic frac
The 4D measurement should be applied every few weeks other than every few years. So It's necessary to use DAS. They use 2 fiber to monitor the frac.
