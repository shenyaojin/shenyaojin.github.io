Here I record some problems on my pc.

# (OpenSSL) libcrypto.so.1.1 problem

After you update your openssl, you may come across this problem. The error message is: 

```
node: error while loading shared libraries: libcrypto.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

## Solution 1: 
You could create a symlink to the shared lib, so: 
```sh
ln -s libcrypto.so.1.1 libcrypto.so
ln -s libssl.so.1.1 libssl.so
```

And reload the cache: 

```sh
sudo ldconfig
```

## Solution 2: 
You could install another version of openssh to directly solve this problem: 

```
% Distribution: Arch Linux.
sudo pacman -S openssl-1.1
```

# Box type structure in wine application

Due to lack of Chinese (or Japanese and Korean) font in wine, we need to install the font in the container.

Enter the winetricks with command: 

```
winetricks --gui
```

And you need to select the default container, and install a font. For insurance you need to choose install all the fonts.

# (Matlab ) libtiff.so.5 can't link to Linux lib

```sh
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/MATLAB/R2017a/bin/glnxa64/libtiff.so.5
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libtiff.so.5.2.4 /usr/local/MATLAB/R2017a/bin/glnxa64/libtiff.so.5
```

While GID activatesï¼Œlibopencv_highgui.so.2.4 needs to use /usr/local/[MATLAB](https://so.csdn.net/so/search?q=MATLAB&spm=1001.2101.3001.7020)/R2017a/bin/glnxa64/libtiff.so.5:. But I guess this version is not compatible with libopencv_highgui.so.2.4's version.

> I used rm -rf deleted libtidy.so.5 ... What a mistake.
