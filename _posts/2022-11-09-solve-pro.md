Here I record some problems on my pc.

# libcrypto.so.1.1

After you update your openssl, you may come across this problem. The error message is: 

```
node: error while loading shared libraries: libcrypto.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

## Solution 1: 
You could create a symlink to the shared lib, so: 
```sh
ln -s libcrypto.so.1.1 libcrypto.so
ln -s libssl.so.1.1 libssl.so
```

And reload the cache: 

```sh
sudo ldconfig
```

## Solution 2: 
You could install another version of openssh to directly solve this problem: 

```
% Distribution: Arch Linux.
sudo pacman -S openssl-1.1
```
