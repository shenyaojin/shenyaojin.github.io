# Where the noise comes from?

$$
\frac1{T_{true}(z,t)}=\frac1{T_{DTS}(z,t)}+c(t)+\int_0^z\delta\alpha(u)du+\varepsilon(x,t)
$$

c(t) is instrument offset bias, the integration is differential attenuation bias and the $$\varepsilon$$ is random noise.

# Offset correction term

We could calculate the average value of the measurement residual at all depth, using it to estimate the offset correction term. 
$$
T_c(z,t) = T_0(z,t) -c(t)
$$

# The linear correction 

Temperature residual after linear correction  is really close to the temperature residual after temperature reciprocal correction, so we do not have to apply the reciprocal correction, which will bring extra calculation.
