# Attenuation and Skin Depth

## Attenuation

Attenuation defines the rate of amplitude loss an EM wave experiences at it propagates. The attenuation of an EM wave is defined by the parameter $$\beta$$. For a down-going planewave, the attenuation is defined as: 
$$
A(z) = A_0e^{\beta z}
$$
where $$A$$ is the amplitude while $$A_0$$ is the absolute amplitude at $$z=0$$m and: 
$$
\beta=\omega(\frac{\mu\epsilon}{2}[(1+\frac{\sigma^2}{\epsilon^2\omega^2})^{\frac12}-1])^{\frac12}\ge0
$$
